I am an assistant professor of Statistics at Cal Poly in beautiful San Luis 
Obispo, California. I teach statistics courses at a variety of levels. In my 
courses students learn statistical concepts alongside data science concepts, so 
they leave their statistics class with a larger understanding of how data 
impacts their discipline and their lives.  

My current research interests are the use of qualitative methods in data science 
education research, outlining a learning trajectory for data science concepts, 
and the role of student identities in classroom discourse. 

In my "free" time, you can find me running or riding my mountain bike on the 
amazing trails around SLO.
